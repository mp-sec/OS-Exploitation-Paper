occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

    specially crafted packet, to disclose sensitive

ETERNALBLUE, ETERNALCHAMPION, ETERNALROMANCE, and ETERNALSYNERGY are
four of multiple Equation Group vulnerabilities and exploits disclosed
on 2017/04/14 by a group known as the Shadow Brokers. WannaCry /
WannaCrypt is a ransomware program utilizing the ETERNALBLUE exploit,
and EternalRocks is a worm that utilizes seven Equation Group
vulnerabilities. Petya is a ransomware program that first utilizes
CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, and then spreads
via ETERNALBLUE.","Microsoft has released a set of patches for Windows Vista, 2008, 7,
2008 R2, 2012, 8.1, RT 8.1, 2012 R2, 10, and 2016. Microsoft has also
released emergency patches for Windows operating systems that are no
longer supported, including Windows XP, 2003, and 8.

For unsupported Windows operating systems, e.g. Windows XP, Microsoft
recommends that users discontinue the use of SMBv1. SMBv1 lacks
security features that were included in later SMB versions. SMBv1 can
be disabled by following the vendor instructions provided in Microsoft
KB2696547. Additionally, US-CERT recommends that users block SMB
directly by blocking TCP port 445 on all network boundary devices. For
SMB over the NetBIOS API, block TCP ports 137 / 139 and UDP ports 137
/ 138 on all network boundary devices.","http://www.nessus.org/u?68fc8eff

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","SMB was detected on port 445 but no credentials were provided.
