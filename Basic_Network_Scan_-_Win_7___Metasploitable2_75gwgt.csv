An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle

version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if

implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

          <p id=""congrats"">If you're seeing this page via a web browser, it means you've setup Tomcat successfully. Congratulations!</p>
 
          <p>As you may have guessed by now, this is the default Tomcat home page. It can be found on the local filesystem at:</p>
          <p class=""code"">$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/index.jsp</p>
	  
          <p>where ""$CATALINA_HOME"" is the root of the Tomcat installation directory. If you're seeing this page, and you don't think you should be, then either you're either a user who has arrived at new installation of Tomcat, or you're an administrator who hasn't got his/her setup quite right. Providing the latter is the case, please refer to the <a href=""tomcat-docs"">Tomcat Documentation</a> for more detailed setup and administration information than is found in the INSTALL file.</p>

            <p><b>NOTE:</b> This page is precompiled. If you change it, this page will not change since
                  it was compiled into a servlet at build time.
                  (See <tt>$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/web.xml</tt> as to how it was mapped.)
            </p>

            <p><b>NOTE: For security reasons, using the administration webapp
            is restricted to users with role ""admin"". The manager webapp
            is restricted to users with role ""manager"".</b>
            Users are defined in <code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml</code>.</p>

            <p>Included with this release are a host of sample Servlets and JSPs (with associated source code), extensive documentation (including the Servlet 2.4 and JSP 2.0 API JavaDoc), and an introductory guide to developing web applications.</p>

            <p>Tomcat mailing lists are available at the Tomcat project web site:</p>

           <ul>
               <li><b><a href=""mailto:users@tomcat.apache.org"">users@tomcat.apache.org</a></b> for general questions related to configuring and using Tomcat</li>
               <li><b><a href=""mailto:dev@tomcat.apache.org"">dev@tomcat.apache.org</a></b> for developers working on Tomcat</li>

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.","https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","SMB was detected on port 445 but no credentials were provided.
